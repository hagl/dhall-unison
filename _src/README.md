**Note:** Unison doesn't store code in text files, but stores the AST of each function in the workspace that is persisted as an sqlite db (in `.unsion` folder of this project).
The code in this folder just serves as a backup/reference of the files I used when I started building dhall-unison. 

It might be out of date and will be removed once I'm more familiar with the normal development process in Unsion.
